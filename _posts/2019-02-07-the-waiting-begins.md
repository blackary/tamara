# The Waiting Begins

Lots of doctors, lots of nurses (many of whom know Tamara well and love her dearly). Lots of medical terminology. Lots of equipment. Lots of tests. Lots of sensors. From a human perspective, it's hard to comprehend all of the people and things that are going into making this surgery go smoothly.

We are so thankful for all of these things. But, more than all these, as we gathered around Tamara's bed before they whisk her away, we are thankful for the God who is watching over her. As we prayed with her, and sang Psalm 42 and 121 around her bed, we are trusting in Him.

> By day the LORD commands his steadfast love,
>    and at night his song is with me,
>    a prayer to the God of my life.
>Why are you cast down, O my soul,
>    and why are you in turmoil within me?
>  Hope in God; for I shall again praise him,
>    my salvation and my God.
>Behold, he who keeps Israel
>    will neither slumber nor sleep.
>The LORD is your keeper;
>    the LORD is your shade on your right hand.
>The LORD will keep you from all evil;
>    he will keep your life.
