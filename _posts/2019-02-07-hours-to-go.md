# Hours to Go

We're still waiting. A couple of hours ago, everyone except me and baby Rosie decided to go out for a walk and get some fresh air. They came across a sheep paddock and enjoyed some [conversation with the sheep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_fKc_znXzI&feature=youtu.be). 

On a much more serious note, we've enjoyed singing Psalm 23 and being reminded of the amazing reality of God's care for us and presence with us. At one point, I was struck with the thought of how desperately we want and need God to be close to us and to Tamara. And yet, how incredible that while He IS right here with us, intimately involved in this event that has seemingly taken up all of our lives and left everything else in a blur, His presence is not limited to this event. He is so much bigger than we can understand or imagine. 

As everyone else was out walking, the hospital chaplain came by to check on us. They made a note to pray specifically for Tamara this morning and have been praying with us for her. He and I talked, and he reminded me that our minds are powerful things. We can let our imaginations go to a lot of places, but God tells us to set our minds "on things above, where Christ is seated" (Col. 3:2). What a good and helpful reminder, especially as I find that every time I really think about and try to wrap my mind around on what is happening in the operating room, I get pretty horrified and afraid. 

We are thankful again for a brief update from Tamara's anesthesiologist friend that she remains stable, and they are making slow and steady progress. It will likely still be hours more before she comes out of surgery. They are doing "tedious work" to separate the wall of the tumor from the surface of her brain. He compared to working with "grains of sand." We've been told to be prepared for her to possibly be sedated through the night due to the length of the surgery. 

Please pray for strength and freedom from fatigue for the surgeons (a second surgeon is assisting at this point), for continued stability and safety for Tamara, and for patience for us as we wait.
