# Looking Back and Forward

When I kissed Tamara goodbye and left the room, I thought in my mind, "she'll never be the same." She had a huge big smile on her beautiful face. 

I had prayed through the whole surgery that they would get all of the tumor out, and that it would just be a one-time thing.

So, when Tamara got out of surgery, I was quite devastated. Not only because they said they didn't get all of the tumor, but because when I saw her, she was as white as a ghost. It brought back painful memories of my first brain tumor surgery. My mother asked how I felt, and I whispered three times (because the first two times she couldn't hear me), "I feel like a Mac Truck just ran over me." My surgery was much shorter, so I couldn't imagine how awful Tamara must feel. I was thinking that God had not answered my prayer about her just having surgery once, but maybe He has. We still don't know if she will have to have a second surgery, but are very happy that she has come through the first one so well. She is not my spunky Tamara yet, but I am hopeful that my baby girl will come back the way she used to be. 

I read today in Romans 11, “Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!” I said, “Lord, we don’t know why you brought this tumor to Tamara, or more trauma to our family, but we are trusting your judgements and the path you have for her.”

(God keeps blowing us away with the way He’s cared for us during this trial. Tamara’s neighbor, who she only met 3 weeks ago when they moved in, has become an adopted aunt. She drove us to the grocery store, offered her guest room for any family who come to visit, and even got a buzz cut to match Tamara’s, as you can see in the picture above.)
