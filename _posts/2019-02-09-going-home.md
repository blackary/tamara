# Going Home

Tamara has been issued her discharge papers and is ready to go home as soon as she finishes her long-awaited breakfast! We have an exclusive interview with the star herself 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RqTF-VNtKI) if you'd like to see and hear how she is doing. We are amazed and thankful at the dramatic progress she has made in the last 24 hours. She is very happy to be going home--as Dr. Abrams noted, "patients do better at home." Please pray for the adjustment and for her continued recovery. Mom will be here for another week and a half to help Stephen care for her, and her Australian sister, Maria, and I hope to come spend time with her in a couple of weeks, as well. Stephen's sister, Evelyn, is also coming on Monday to be with them. The rest of us will be leaving Monday and Tuesday. We are so very thankful we could be here with her and for the way God has stretched our faith and strengthened our bonds with each other through this time. We will be glad to no longer make the ICU our home base, though. :) 

I realized this morning that while many of you know and love Tamara, many of you have never met her. I thought I could give you a little picture of what this amazing lady is like and some of the things that make her such a special person to so many. 

Tamara was born on my third birthday, and I didn't always look at that as a blessing. In fact, I told her adamantly that she was NOT invited to my 12th birthday party...which was held in our basement. My mom later made me say otherwise. Despite our somewhat rocky start to our relationship, Tamara has since forgiven me, and I consider her one of my very dearest friends. 

Tamara is what we call the "glue" in our family. With five siblings stretched across the U.S. and the world, it's not easy for us all to keep in close contact with each other. But Tamara makes this happen. She regularly calls not only her siblings but also her siblings' spouses to catch up on life. Even with all of those people to keep up with, Tamara also manages to communicate with friends from across the world on a regular basis, and she also makes a point to work in lunch dates and outings with local friends and people she's wanting to know better. God has gifted her with incredible relational skills and has endeared her to many, many people's hearts. 

Along with her winsome personality, God has given Tamara deep faith in Jesus that encourages, challenges, and attracts people to her. During her stay in the hospital, she has shined for Jesus by talking about His care for her and by asking many of her nurses and hospital staff whether they are Christians (and found out many are). She often prays with and for people who are suffering, and at every family gathering we have, she initiates a time of sharing and prayer. While we sometimes tease her about her long prayers, we are so thankful for how she keeps turning us to Christ in times of joy or sorrow. 

Tamara is what I would describe as a "fierce woman"--fiery, candid, and full of conviction. She can get away with saying things that no one else can. People are willing to listen to hard things she says because they know she cares for them. She's also incredibly compassionate, which is a big reason she pursued nursing as a career. School does not come especially easily to Tamara, but she has excelled in her nursing through her hard work and tender heart towards others. 

I could go on and on about her sense of humor, contagious laugh, and spunky personality. But as I wrap this up, I want to clearly recognize the fact that all of these things that make Tamara such a beautiful person are ultimately because of her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. He made her, loved her, and died for her. She is not just a "good person" in and of herself, but she has been redeemed by Jesus, bought by His blood on the cross, and made a new creature. He is continuing the work He began in her to make her more beautiful, more like Jesus. And while we greatly rejoice in God answering our prayers to preserve Tamara through this surgery, we know that our ultimate joy, and her ultimate hope, are not grounded in Tamara having more years on this earth. Our hope, and her hope, is in eternal life with Jesus Christ in heaven, a hope that is offered to all of those who believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins. 

Well, I'd better sign off so we can load up the posters, flowers, and this precious girl and take her home. 

*Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you*
