# Up and About

Over the past couple of days, Tamara has continued to grow in strength. I am constantly amazed by her irrepressible spirit -- she never seems to get tired of talking to people, sharing her story with them, asking them about how they're doing, and thanking them for their care.

On Thursday and Friday, Tamara and Stephen hosted several friends, mostly friends from Christian Grad Fellowship or church. People often stop by in the afternoon for anywhere from half-an-hour to two hours. They spend time talking about anything and everything -- Tamara's surgery, of course, but also runner's high, bad students, the military.... Their close friends, Zach and Ally, came over to celebrate Valentine's Day with chocolate lava cakes on Thursday evening. Stephen and Tamara were kind enough to let Mrs. Blackwood and me crash their little foursome.

On Friday, Tamara, Stephen, Mrs. Blackwood, and I went out for lunch at Local Boyz, a Hawaiian cafe. Then Stephen gave us a tour of his office and lab. Tamara stopped to talk to everyone. All the postdocs and grad students know her; the secretaries know her; the professors know her. Everyone hugged her and praised her, full of amazement that she's up and about.

Friday evening, we went over to Stephen and Tamara's neighbor's house. Terri and her dog Tucker have been hosting me during my time here, and Terri made her famous mac n' cheese for the four of us for dinner. We stayed to listen to a concert of piano music that Terri and Stephen played.

Throughout these days, I give thanks to God for Tamara's bright and loving spirit. I give thanks to God for Stephen's gentleness and strength.

Please pray that both Stephen and Tamara, especially Tamara, would be able to sleep. Whether because of medications or lack of physical activity, Tamara has only been able to sleep for a handful of hours a night. She does try to rest a little morning and afternoon, but she often doesn't sleep then either. Please intercede with us that she would be able to get true rest.
