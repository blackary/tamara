# Stretching Her Wings

Tuesday morning, Tamara said good-bye to her father and her sister Charity and niece Rosie. Afterward, the four of us – Tamara, Stephen, Mrs. Blackwood, and Stephen's older sister Evelyn – spent a quiet day resting. Tamara continues to grow stronger slowly but surely.

After a nap this afternoon, Tamara had her first outing – to the bank to take out money for rent. Of course, she insisted on going into the bank. She told the clerk about her surgery and sympathized with her clerk, whose fiancee also just went through surgery. We dropped by Stephen and Tamara's old landlord's house to give him the rent, and again, Tamara had a long conversation with him. She thanked him for the time she and Stephen had had living in his basement and hoped that his next tenants will be suitable. He told Tamara that she and Stephen had set a very high bar for those next tenants.

When we got home again, the four of us went for a very short walk across the cul-de-sac and over a little bridge. Tamara held Stephen's arm with one hand and her cane with the other as she walked, but she outpaced Evelyn and Mrs. Blackwood quickly.

Throughout our interactions today, we continue to be blessed by Tamara's shining care for other people. We praise God for His beautiful love reflected by her spirit and for His work of healing in her body.
