Dear Praying Friends,

It's hard to know exactly what to write. Tamara is out of surgery. She did well throughout the surgery, and the surgeon is planning to make sure she's responding well neurologically soon. We expect to be able to go and see her soon. 

The difficult news is that the tumor appears to be an incredibly rare variety. The doctor thinks it might be something called "falx chondroma". This type of tumor is so rare that the two surgeons with 50+ years of experience have never seen anything like it. They'll know for sure after they hear back from pathology. The literature, the little there is on this type of tumor, suggests that it is benign and slow-growing, which is good news.

Because the tumor contains a lot of bone, removing it was very difficult, and they were only able to remove 60-70%. It may be that she will need another surgery in 3 months to remove the remaining part of the tumor on the other side of her brain, and they may never be able to remove it all because of where some of it is located.

It will likely require periodic scans for the rest of her life to make sure it doesn't start growing again. 

There are many reasons to give thanks, and many reasons to keep praying. We are exhausted and confused, but thankful and desperately clinging to the God for whom none of this is a mystery, who knows every hair on her head, and who has loved her from before the foundation of the earth.

> Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. 

In Christ,
Zachary, for all of us
