The difficult news is that the tumor appears to be an incredibly rare variety. The doctor thinks it might be something called "falx chondroma". This type of tumor is so rare that the two surgeons with 50+ years of experience have never seen anything like it. They'll know for sure after they hear back from pathology. The literature, the little there is on this type of tumor, suggests that it is benign and slow-growing, which is good news.

Because the tumor contains a lot of bone, removing it was very difficult, and they were only able to remove 60-70%. It may be that she will need another surgery in 3 months to remove the remaining part of the tumor on the other side of her brain, and they may never be able to remove it all because of where some of it is located.
