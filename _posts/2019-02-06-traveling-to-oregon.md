We continue to pray & prepare. Several family members are travelling right now to Oregon to be with Tamara & Stephen.  

We are so thankful that, as much as we love Tamara, her Creator who knitted her together in her mother's womb knows and loves her so much more, and will never cease watching over her.
I'll probably have another update this evening, but for now, could you please pray particularly:

- For clarity from today's tests that will help guide the surgeon's work tomorrow
- For sleep for Tamara and Stephen tonight -- it has been a difficult week with little sleep
- For unbelieving friends, family and medical staff to see Tamara's faith in her Creator and Savior, and come to believe in Him also
