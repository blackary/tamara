# A Day of Rest

How fitting that Tamara's first full day at home would be the Lord's Day. Though she would have loved to be in worship, she got to spend the morning at home with her sister, resting and listening to a sermon together. The rest of us got to worship with Tamara and Stephen's home congregation, and were yet again reminded of the love of their local church body, and of the unity of Christ's body worldwide. As we met these saints, both their love for Tamara and Stephen and their love for us as brothers and sisters in Christ were apparent. As some of us get ready to travel back across the country, we are thankful to be leaving them in such loving hands.

Tamara continues to improve and be more and more herself. She's still mostly sitting and lying down, but is able to get around with some help. A friend from their church loaned her a pair of canes, and though she wasn't too sure about using a cane at first, she's now thankful for the increased mobility they give her.

Tonight we got to meet Tamara's neighbor, a dear Christian retired woman who promised to visit with Tamara regularly, and immediately agreed to host Stephen's sister at her house this week. We're reminded again of the goodness of God in remarking that it was not good that man would be alone but in His kindness putting us in families, churches and communities. We're also thankful for His kind gift of a day of rest and the reminder of the need and blessing of worshipping and fellowshipping with His people. 

As various family members get ready to leave soon, and others are making plans to come and help over the next few weeks; as we wait for the results of the pathology of Tamara's tumor; as we look with little medical certainty towards what the future holds in the coming weeks, months and years for Tamara; we are glad to be resting in the God who blesses us with families and homes, who gives us rest, and who holds us and our future in His hands.

> who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
> who satisfies you with good
> so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
