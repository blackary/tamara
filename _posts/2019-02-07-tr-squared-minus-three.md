(Tamara Rose * Tumor Resection = TR squared for this geeky dad - but for the rest of this post TR2)

“Praying for you.” “God is in control.” Such words sound, to many, as empty hope. No more, and maybe less effective than “good luck.” But they are true words and helpful words. It means so much to us that people from all over the world are praying for us. It was such a blessing last night for our immediate family to gather from all over the world by Skype and pray together.

And, now, as we are at TR2 minus 3, God’s sovereign love and control are my comfort. But they are a comfort in the midst of tears, not instead of them. My sobs, more than my song, waking the dawn this morning. (See Psalm 57:7-8) My heart is not steadfast – it is weak and fearful. And, yet, for certain:

Psalm 57:9–11 (CSB)

9 I will praise you, Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. 10 For your faithful love is as high as the heavens; your faithfulness reaches the clouds. 11 God, be exalted above the heavens; let your glory be over the whole earth.

I thank the Lord that He IS in control. I thank the Lord that when I am afraid, I can trust in Him. (Psalm 56:2) I thank the Lord that He keeps count of my tossings, and puts my tears in His bottle. They are in His book.

TR2 minus 3. Thank you for praying for us. Thank God that He is in control.
