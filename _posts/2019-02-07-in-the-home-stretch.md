# In the Home Stretch

We are thankful that we were able to get another update from Tamara's surgical nurse. She's still doing well, and they estimate that they will be finishing in around 1.5 hours. It's amazing what a relief it is to hear that the end is in sight. We have been amazed by the kindness of Tamara and Stephen's church family, and of Tamara's co-workers at the hospital. They've worked together to keep us updated, cared for, and well fed. The nursing staff even prepared some welcome posters for her to see when she wakes up. 

One of the benefits of have such a long wait is that we've had the delight to be able to pray together and sing through many Psalms together with friends, family and staff. Psalms 4, 23, 42, 62, 72, 73, 100, and others. God has sustained us with his Word, as we have sung to Him, to each other, and to our own souls. Psalm 62 has recently given us words to speak to our souls, reminding us to rest on God. Pray for us & for Tamara as we keep waiting on him, both for the next hours, and for the days, weeks and months of recovery that are sure to come. Thank you for your prayers and your love.

> For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence,
> for my hope is from him.
> He only is my rock and my salvation,
> my fortress; I shall not be shaken.
> On God rests my salvation and my glory;
> my mighty rock, my refuge is God.
> Trust in him at all times, O people;
> pour out your heart before him;
> God is a refuge for us.
