On Monday, our family Facebook group received a message from my little sister Tamara, and the first line stopped us all in our tracks.

*Dear family. I have some bad news...*

As it happens, Tamara was jumping off a cliff into water with her cousins on July 4th last year. Ever since then, she has had a pulsation in her ear. The Dr suggested an MRI, and though Tamara and her husband Stephen initially weren't sure they were going to get one, they decided to go ahead and have it done. 

During the MRI, they discovered a very large tumor on Tamara's brain. The initial diagnosis was that it was a benign meningioma. Going through my mom's experience with three different brain tumors years ago didn't help relieve the shock of this news. She scheduled an appointment with the neurosurgeon on Tuesday afternoon. Meanwhile, we all began to pray. Already we could see God's hand in this as, without the MRI, the tumor may have not been discovered until much later. Thus far He has been good to us, and we knew His faithfulness would continue.
