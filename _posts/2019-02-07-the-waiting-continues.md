# The Waiting Continues

> 1. I waited for the LORD;
> He stooped and heard my cry.
> He brought me from a pit,
> Out of the dungeon mire,
> My feet set on a rock,
> My footsteps made secure.
> My lips He gave a song,
> A song to praise our God. Psalm 40A stanza 1 Book of Psalms for Worship

We continue to wait. And wait. There are 8 of us in the waiting room. Every hour, close to on the hour, we stop our visiting, games, sighing, etc, to pray and sing a psalm. What a great God we wait on and for!

An anesthesiologist friend from Stephen and Tamara's church (who is not on her case, but has access), just told us, "I just checked with the OR.  They made incision at 10:00 and everything is going well so far." So, that is a brief update (apparently they got a later start than anticipated). God knows. God cares. We keep waiting.

About an hour ago some of Tamara's friends and coworkers brought in team Tamara ribbons to wear. We wear them while we wait.
