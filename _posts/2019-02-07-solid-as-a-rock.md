# Solid as a Rock

We just got an update from Tamara's Anaesthesiologist friend. He said she's physically "as solid as a rock." The surgery continues on, as we pray and sing each hour in the waiting room. He let us know that they're having to be very careful as they work around the tumor, so it's slow-going. They expect the surgery to last hours longer, probably into the evening (Oregon time). 

Normally, as nothing substantial has changed, we'd be left to wait with "no news is good news", so we're very thankful for the blessing of these extra updates. 

We're also thankful for our God, and Tamara's God, who is our Rock, no matter what happens, and that Tamara is in His loving hands.
