# A Day of Preparation

Today Tamara spent several hours at the hospital getting some final scans done to map out the details of the tumor and all of the veins, arteries, etc. involved. The nursing staff also prepared her with things she needs to do and not do in order to get ready. As a final personal preparation step, Tamara decided that since she would be getting a large chunk of her hair cut off entirely, she'd go ahead and shorten all of her hair. Her dear friend Erin from work came over to do the haircut. During the haircut, some family members arrived, and Tamara and Stephen got to meet their new niece Rosie for the first time. 

Tonight some of her family and friends will be gathering virtually from around the world to pray with and for Tamara & Stephen. Please join us in bringing them before the throne of grace. 

*For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
and his ears are open to their prayer.*
