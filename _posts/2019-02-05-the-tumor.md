We all went about our lives, praying, crying, waiting. On Tuesday evening, we heard back from Tamara's appointment. The tumor is large. On the scan, to my eyes, it's almost unbelievably large. It's hard to believe that thing is actually in her head.

They're not confident about what type of tumor it is -- the surgeon said it could be one of four different types. The surgery is scheduled for Thursday, Feb 7th at 8AM PST. Stephen & Tamara were very happy with their surgeon and the team at the Corvallis hospital, who were hopeful but not unrealistic about the risks involved. Tamara works as a Nurse in the Corvallis hospital system in the Emergency Department, and so is glad to be working with a system she knows well.They also talked with a friend who is a neurosurgeon in California, and got his advice on their options. The surgery is expected to take between 2 and 10 hours. Afterwards, if all goes well, the Dr recommended Tamara take off 3 months of work. 

She'll be undergoing more tests and scans to prep for surgery on Wednesday, February 6th. 

We continue to be overwhelmed by God's faithfulness, especially as expressed by the loving support and prayers of our friends and families. As Tamara told her surgeon, "We serve a big God, and we have lots of people praying for us."
