# One week post-surgery

## T’s thoughts on the past few weeks…

Dear Friends (old ones, new ones, some I don’t even know),

Thank you so much for praying for me these past 10 days! I can’t even believe how many people have been praying! Thank you, dear brother Zachary and family for posting for me when I was unable. Thank you, church, work, and blood family for helping so much through your prayers, gifts, flowers, posters, kind messages, and encouragement! What a BLESSING you have been by supporting me and Stephen and supporting our families!

 We love you all so very much!

What a hectic three weeks it’s been for us. Here is what it looked like from my perspective.

Mon., Jan 14: We looked on Zillow and found a few houses to check out. 

Tues., Jan 15: We visited this house we’re in now and liked it.

Thurs., Jan 17: Our new landlords said we could apply for the house.

Sat., Jan 19: We signed the lease and got the keys! 

The next week, we moved the “guts” of our house slowly (clothes, books, kitchen, plants, etc.) in between my night ED nursing shifts and S’s research work. 

Sat., Jan 26: Had an Australia day moving party with some close friends from church. We rented a u-hall and moved all the furniture! What a blessing this place has been because it has no stairs (we lived in a basement apartment before). God knew we needed a quick move! 

Week of Jan 27: Between 12-hour night shifts, I cleaned our old place and set up our new place. I worked Jan 28 – Feb 2. S did more setup while I slept / worked. My glasses broke on Thursday, right before three BUSY shifts, and I had hold them together with tape. Also, I started coming down with a cold. We were so exhausted that we completely forgot about our community group one night – the night we were supposed to be leading! It was a busy few weeks, but life was about to get crazier!

Mon., Feb 4: I got up early to see if it had snowed. It had not. We went along in our normal morning routine. I went in at 9am for an MRI & MRA for a pulsation in my right ear. I wasn’t going to do it because the ENT said, “It’s just to rule out the big stuff, and it will probably be negative,” but our insurance is really good, so we decided I would just do it. While I was lying on the table for 45 minutes, I prayed for all of my family on both sides and thought at the end, “It’d be nice if this was my last MRI….” Little did I know. The MRI tech said, “We’ll let the doctor know your results, and he’ll be in touch.” I saw a friend after my scan who I hadn’t seen in a few weeks, which was nice. 

After I got home, I went straight to the couch because I was still fighting my cold and didn’t feel well. I was messaging people and looking for ways to get a table we inherited from Grandpa and Grandpa Noell from Stillwater, OK to Corvallis, OR (btw, if anyone has any ideas, please let us know!). 

1:01pm: Dr Benton (ENT) called and told me, “I got your MRI results. It looks like there is an artery that’s looped that may be causing the pulsation. But the bigger issue is we found a tumour... and it’s pretty large. It could be causing the pulsation, but it could be completely unrelated.” My heart started beating faster and I thought, “Is this real? I’ve joked about having brain tumours my whole life, because my mum had three.” So especially when I’ve done something clumsy, it’s been a convenient excuse. 

Dr Benton said, “We think it’s a benign meningioma.” I wrote that down. He was very kind and told me that he was concerned and wanted to discuss my MRI with a neurosurgeon. He suggested Dr Abrams, with whom he’d worked before, and I said “Ok. I guess I’ll follow up with you later.” I got off the phone and was pretty shocked and just breathed some prayers. Then I texted Stephen to ask if I could call him. He said he was finishing up a boring PhD defence and asked if it was an emergency and if I wanted him to leave. He only had 5 minutes left. “No,” I wrote. As an ER nurse, I didn’t think it was a true emergency. I said, “But it’s urgent, so call as soon as you can.” 

That was a long 10 minutes before he could get out and call me back – I read the radiology report on the portal. 9cm x 6cm?? How could it be that big? When I spoke with S, he was very calm. I think we were both in shock. I called my parents next. My dad was on his way home, so I spoke with my mum for a little bit and choked up telling her. She said she felt sick. They were already making plans to come out if I had to have surgery. While talking with my parents, Dr Abrams’s office called and said that she wanted to see me tomorrow (Tuesday) at 1:30pm. It was a relief that I could get in so quickly, but also slightly scary. 

I texted my friend Ally (from church) next. We’d been over at her and her husband’s house the night before (Zach is her husband’s name). She knew that I was having an MRI. I said, “I got some bad news from the dr. Can I call you?” She said her first thought was, “Lord, please help Tamara not have a brain tumour.” I choked up when she told me that. 

S came home around 3pm. He brought me lunch (cheese, crackers, and veggies) because I hadn’t hardly moved from the couch. We called more family, cried and prayed with them, and sent group family messages. How do you say, “Hi guys. How’s your day? So, I have a brain tumour. Love you all!”?! We texted our pastor, Greg, who has been such a faithful friend and pastor to us. 

We had our Christian Graduate Group Bible study on campus at 5pm. That was a nice distraction and lovely to have people to pray for us in person! Zach and Ally (Z&A) had us over for dinner, and it was lovely not to have to cook and nice to laugh with friends. We went to bed exhausted, emotionally and physically. I told S that my fear was, “What if it’s nothing? All this fuss and they just want to monitor me for years to come….!” That was not the case.

Tues., Feb 5: We woke up to snow! S worked from home. We made some more calls. I set up our guest room because I needed to keep myself busy. Our pastor came over, brought us Chinese lunch, and prayed over me. 

I got a call from radiology saying that Dr Abrams had booked me for a second MRI & MRA (which actually was an MRV). Lots of paperwork to fill out in the doctor’s office. I was thankful I wasn’t an old person with a huge med list and lots of chronic illnesses. After talking with the nurse, Dr Abrams came in, checked some reflexes, asked about my symptoms, and asked S if he had noticed any personality changes (he said no :) ). She showed us the picture of the MRI. Wow! That took my breath away and made me tear up. “That is in ME?!? How can that be!?” I squeezed S’s hand. 

Dr Abrams told us that she’d moved some things around and booked the OR yesterday (Monday) for Thursday at 8am- less than two days away! She was concerned that the tumour was pressing on my brain stem and crowding my brain’s motor and sensory centres. She told us that she thought it looked unusual for a benign meningioma and that it could be X, Y, or Z. I asked her to write those down. She promised to if I wouldn’t Google them. She said, “We’ll be monitoring you throughout the whole surgery, but I don’t have a crystal ball, and I can’t tell you the outcome. I think it will be a long surgery, 2-10 hours, depending on what we find. I want you to go into this surgery with all the good mental strength you can.” I told her that we serve a big God and that we already have people all over the world praying. “Good. Prayer chains are great!” she said. She was very kind and asked us how we were going with all the news, and I said “Well, I can’t change it, so I’ve just got to face it. We’re trusting God is in control.” 

She told me I’d need to take three months off work. She also said that the whole neurosurgical team had seen and discussed my scan and that her partner would support her if she got tired. The nurse came in and gave us the pre-surgery paperwork that we needed to do before Thursday. 

S&I went straight across the street to the ED and waited in a conference room. We called our parents while we waited for my boss to get out of a meeting so that we could tell her. Our parents and my work were so very supportive! Lots of tears, hugs, and prayers! We told our parents we’d love them to be here to support us, but we understood it was very sudden. My boss said that she’d help me with whatever I needed. It was very overwhelming for S to be at my work while I showed all the doctors and nurses my scan and said, with tears in my eyes, “That’s in my head.” What a shock! 

Random thoughts: People asked me if, besides the pulsation, I’ve been “symptom free.” The answer is no. I’ve had migraines since I was 7 (not sure if my tumour has been growing that long?), and in the past 14 months, I’ve definitely had more nausea, head and neck pain, and dizziness. But it hasn’t been consistent enough to get checked out, except by a sports massage therapist, who did help a little. I also started working 12-hour night shifts in September. I thought that I was still getting used to the different sleep pattern. And no, I’m not pregnant (everyone asks because of the nausea!). 

But I do really think that having a mum go through brain tumours and always wondering about it myself helped me be more prepared. The week before I found out, I’d even said to my sister Charity, “Imagine if we actually got a brain tumour.” Plus, being an ER nurse, I’ve seen people deal with tragedy very well (and some very poorly). I know it is by God’s grace, but I’ve been thankful to have this attitude: “I can’t change this. God is in control. God knows and sees me and is the best neurosurgeon there is EVER!” At the same time, putting my life in the hands of someone I’d just met a few days before and of people I didn’t even know in the operating room was very stressful. I had an option to get a second opinion from a friend’s son’s friend, who is an excellent neurosurgeon. But it just felt like too much. I am so grateful that my hospital, who loves me and backs me, had the expertise and the operating room opening to perform my surgery. 

We came home, ate leftovers, called more family, and went to sleep. I didn’t sleep well, but I had LOTS of very encouraging messages from friends that I got to catch up on, which was lovely. 

Wed., Feb 6: Woke up in a dream. Is this real? Busy day! Z&A came over with goodies, a “brain tumour present” (fuzziest PJ pants, nice Chapstick & body wash, etc.), and breakfast. We talked and prayed. Zach said, “What are they going to fill it with after they take it out? Tissue paper?!” I am thankful you’re not my neurosurgeon, Zach! :D After we finished praying, another friend from church brought two pots of flowers (roses and tulips), and then Greg and his wife Dolly came over with their pack’n’play for my little niece Rosie, who was coming to stay with my sister Charity. They chatted with us and prayed with us before we went to the hospital for all my pre-surgical tests: EKG, blood tests, X-ray, meeting with the surgical nurse, MRI, and MRV. I had to sign some stuff for my work, so I printed that out and got more hugs from work people. 

I was exhausted and hungry, so S got my lunch from the hospital café – which did wonders for my spirits. My friend Tricia picked up my new glasses (remember, my old ones broke, so I only had one ear piece). My ER friend, Erin, came over that afternoon with presents (fuzzy blanket, kangaroo and koala socks, little slippers, etc.) and buzzed my head. My brother Zachary, sister Charity, her baby girl Rosie, and my parents arrived while this was going on, which was chaotic. I was having fun getting my head buzzed. My family was a little shocked. Erin was wonderful – such a calming presence! 

Z&A brought us dinner (three kinds of soup!) and their fold-out table so that we could all fit! I had a shower and was feeling very excited about my new haircut, though I worried about a few loose hairs. I really wanted to pluck my eyebrows and paint my toenails, too, which I did (despite my brother’s teasing). I’m glad I did because you feel better in hospital when you’re more put together. We had a Blackwood Skype prayer time, and at the end of it, two more friends from church brought a few more little gifts (slippers for me and lollies for S)! My anaesthesiologist for the next day, Tony Rinaldi, called. He was very kind and talked through some stuff with me. We ended the night with family devotions (singing, praying, and reading a devotional) and then went to bed. I was so exhausted emotionally and physically that my chest hurt. I had had so little sleep, and I had maxed out my people capacity, so I just sobbed my heart out to S.  

Thurs., Feb 7: Surgery day! I woke up early, feeling pretty energized and ready to get things done! After leaving a little late and saying hi my ER friends, I went into the pre-op room. They had to stick me three times to get in the IV. :( But I knew the IV therapy nurse, and he’s very good, so I don’t hold it against him! I got to see two doctor friends from church (Shawn and Andrew), which was great, and my family (including Stephen’s parents, who had arrived late the night before!). All of them and our pastor prayed and sang around my bed. They prayed over Dr Abrams and Dr Rinaldi as well. What a blessing! Everyone was very nice, and I enjoyed asking people their names and joking with OR staff before they put me under sedation. Then I “slept” for 13 hours.

Fri., Feb 8: I think I went to CT after surgery. Then I went up to ICU and got settled before my family came in. I really have very little memory of seeing them – more like dreams of telling S things that were hard to get out. I felt very groggy. I was in and out of consciousness, nauseous, and so tired that I didn’t want to swallow or spit out the spit in my mouth – but then I would fall back asleep and wake up coughing. 

Two nurses worked with me. Tori was doing her preceptorship; I had done hospital orientation with her back in Aug 2018. Nadine was a lovely “four foot nothing,” very, VERY tender-hearted nurse. They both worked hard overnight to help with my nausea. They let me know every time my neurological vital signs improved. They were so affirming! They gave me ice chips, and then my morning nurses, Julie and Aubrey (student), gave me a glass of water – the most delicious glass of water I’ve ever had, “Thank you Jesus!” – especially after all my nausea. I think the nausea was mainly from the opioid pain relief, my urinary catheter being blocked at one point, and the anaesthesia meds wearing off. 

By 5am, I started to wake up more, and my friend Erin popped in to say hi. Next, my dad. I noticed the three posters in my room that my mother-in-law and friends from the ER had made! How lovely it was to wake up to those. S called, which was so nice. Then I went down to my MRI. I was still pale and pathetic that morning, but I started feeling better. I saw my doctors after the MRI and got Jimmy Johns for lunch! They said I could be discharged from ICU and get my lines out later that day. 

S sat by my bed during “quiet hours” and read. That night, family sang and prayed with me, which was lovely! Justine was my nurse that night, but Nadine, who had picked up a CNA shift, was going to help me have a bed bath. Then she decided to help me get out of bed and took me to a different ward to have a shower. She also brushed my teeth. That was pure bliss. Someone else made my bed (with my special “brain tumour blanket” that kids from church had made) and rearranged my room so that I could see the snow falling from my window. The little things in life really make a world of difference…. I felt human again and so cared for. I actually slept for a few hours peacefully, thanks partly to the sound machine that my friend Tricia from church let me borrow! 

Sat., Feb 8: Got to go home!! It was nice to see my ED family on my way out. My parents and parents-in-law ran errands for us and picked up prescriptions. My dad and my brother put a new electric garage opener on our garage! My mother and mother-in-law bought me a recliner and little tables for all our flowers. I definitely felt weak (not moving for 13 hours REALLY hurt my neck, arms, and legs!). I was telling people how amazing it was that they could just stand up and walk without effort! But I agreed with Dr Abrams that I could rest better at home – fewer sick people, more flowers. It’s been wonderful. 

Well, now it’s been a week since surgery and 5 days since I’ve been home! I’ve been slowly gaining strength. I’m using a trusty cane from my friends Sue and Dave (church) and am getting stronger every day! My first outing was on Tuesday (see Evelyn’s post), and that was great. On Wednesday (yesterday), though, I was wiped out and had both a morning nap and an afternoon nap! But after visitors and more flowers, I got a 20-minute walk in, which was pretty good for me! It’s been such a blessing to have family here (Evelyn (Stephen’s sister) and my mum) to help with cleaning and prepping meals. Our church family is giving us a meal every other day for two weeks, and then my work family is going to to bring two weeks of meals- THANK YOU ALL!!!
 
Please keep praying for me as I rest and learn how to slow down (I’m a recovering “do-too-mucher”)! Pray for more family coming and going next week. They will be with me while S goes to Puerto Rico for his first academic conference (he’ll be gone Feb 21 – March 2). Please pray that I would live one day at a time, trusting Jesus to carry me all the way though this recovery! 

My plan is to take three months off work. My stiches are supposed to come out next week on the 19th.  I or a family member will be updating this blog with reports of the tumour pathology (it was sent off to various researchers). We should know more about it by Feb 28th.

Thank you for reading my long, rambling update. Thank you for pleading with us for Jesus’ healing for me and for strength for our family. Thank you for loving us so practically as well! 

LOTS of LOVE,
Tamara Rose Noell
