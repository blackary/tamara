# New Morning Mercies

Lamentations 3:21–23 (CSB)
21 Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope: 22 Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. 23 They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness!

I posted this to our family about 6:30 PST this morning: Hi, family. I woke up at 5 and couldn't go back to sleep. So I came to see Tamara. She's doing good. Still very groggy. Having some nausea and pain. They're caring for her well. MRI scheduled for 8am. I'm just sitting by her bed holding her hand. I'll go back to the house before long.

And, from Stephen Noell just a few minutes ago: I just called Tamara, she sounds tired but well, still has nausea from the pain meds. Sounded like they are backed up in the MRI room but she'll probably go in soon.

Today we will likely find out more about the plan going forward. We are all still a bit down - thankful she is out of that loooooong surgery, nervous about what is next. Yet, seeking to remember the Lord's new morning mercies. So thankful for the care and prayer of His people. Don't stop.
