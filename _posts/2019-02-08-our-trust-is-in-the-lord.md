# Our Trust is in the Lord

What gives us hope? In an unexpected providence, Nancy, Charity, and I ran in to the neurosurgeon in the hallway 1 floor up from the ICU. She hopes to give us more info later today (she has another surgical case now). However, she did tell us that, while they still have to get neuropathology reports (and perhaps specialty neuropathologists) she thinks it is very likely that this is, in fact, a non-malignant growth. She said the CT post-op scan from last night showed already that her brain, where the tumor has been removed, is already returning toward normal. She said that Tamara is doing great and will be released from ICU soon and likely will go home tomorrow!

In a second unexpected providence, we had just run into the hospital chaplain, Eddie, prior to seeing the surgeon, and he was with us. After we finished with the neurosurgeon, he reminded us it is not so much the clarity of information that gives us hope, but the presence and help of God. Amen!

Most of us have been in to see Tamara this morning. She is still quite groggy, and nauseous. But she is recovering. And we are thankful.

Psalm 118:8â€“9 (CSB) It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in humanity. It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in nobles.
