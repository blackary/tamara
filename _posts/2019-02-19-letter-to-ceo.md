# My Letter to My CEO

If you’re interested, you can read what I wrote to my CEO.

Hi Doug,

I love what a personal CEO you are, and I like reading your Monday morning virtual huddle emails. I wanted to share my story with you, to tell you how God used GSRMC to support me and my family with His love through a difficult time.

My name is Tamara Noell. I’m 25. I’m a Christian, an Australican, and an RN. I was born in Indiana. I’m the youngest girl in my family (second-youngest child of 6), and my dad was a pastor of a small reformed church. We moved to Melbourne, Australia when I was 12 so that he could pastor a church there. We went on a 2-year visa but eventually became citizens. I finished high school and my Bachelor’s of nursing in Australia. I then worked as an RN for 5 years, specializing in critical emergency nursing. I moved to Corvallis in July 2017 to marry the love of my life, Stephen Noell, a molecular biology PhD student at OSU.

It took me 11 months to get registered as an RN in Oregon. I wanted to work in Corvallis ED because I had heard wonderful things about it! A few doctors from our church work there. I approached Jeanne, and she gave me a night shift position that I started in August. What a GREAT team the ED has! They helped me learn the million differences between nursing in the US and in Aus. J

Two weeks ago (2/4/19), after an MRI for a pulsation that I’ve had in my ear for 8 months, my ENT, Dr. Benton, told me that I had a massive brain tumor. He referred me to Dr. Abrams in neurosurgery. My husband and I saw her the next day, and she told me that she had booked the OR for Thursday (2/7/19). The tumor was big a shock! My mom had actually had 3 brain tumors when I was little (‘84, ‘94, and ‘97), completely unrelated and not hereditary. Growing up, I had often thought, “What if I had a brain tumor like mum?” and now I did. She was 24 when she had her first one, just like me.

I went straight across the street to ED to tell my boss, Jeanne. She was, along with all the staff, VERY supportive! We have been overwhelmed by prayers, meals, hugs, #teamtamara T-shirts & ribbons, financial support, and people gathering their Christmas coupons so that my family could be fed while waiting in hospital for me. ED staff even brought lunch to our family the day of my surgery! They’re an amazing, amazing group and have supported me and my family so very much! We’ve had family and friends all over the world praying for us, and the GSRMC was certainly right there with them!

The surgery was very long, 13 hours, and then I spent two nights in ICU. The tumor turned out to be very rare (a falx chondroma). I’m still waiting for the official pathology report. My pre-op team, IV therapists, anaesthesiologist (Dr. Ranaldi), Dr. Abrams, and the staff in ICU were all so amazing! BIG SHOUT OUTS to my ICU nurses, Nadine + Tori (who did my hospital-wide orientation); Julie + Aubrey (student); Bruce (ICU charge nurse), and Brian (PCU). They were all very attentive! John (supervisor) even helped my nurse get warm towels for my first shower! The staff rearranged my bedroom so that I could watch the snow on Friday, 2/8. Talk about VIP treatment! It was my very first experience as a nurse-turned-patient – and very helpful for when I go back to work. It really reminded me that the little things in life make SUCH an impact! On Saturday, 2/9, I went home and am now recovering for three months before, God willing, heading back to GSRMC ED.

I wanted to fill out a patient satisfaction sheet, but my message was too long, so I figured I’d send an email. 
Thank you for being a great CEO and for letting me be part of GSRMC’s family! I am very blessed! With grateful hearts, Tamara (& Stephen)
